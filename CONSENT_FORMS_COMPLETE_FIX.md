# Consent Forms - Complete Fix Summary

## 🚨 Original Problem

**Client submitted consent form → Got "Failed to submit form" error**

---

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### Error Message from Server:
```
500 Internal Server Error
Unknown argument 'allergies'
Invalid prisma.consentForm.update() invocation
```

### What Was Happening:

**Frontend sends:**
```javascript
{
  formData: {
    medicalHistory: {
      allergies: ["Penicillin", "Latex"],  // OBJECT/ARRAY
      medications: ["Aspirin"],             // ARRAY
      conditions: ["Eczema"],               // ARRAY
      surgeries: []
    },
    emergencyContact: {
      name: "John Doe",                     // OBJECT
      relationship: "Spouse",
      phone: "555-1234"
    }
  }
}
```

**Database expects:**
```prisma
medicalHistory   String?  // Not an object!
allergies        String?  // Not an array!
emergencyContact String?  // Not an object!
```

**Prisma Error:** Cannot store objects/arrays in String fields!

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### API Update (`app/api/consent-forms/[clientId]/[token]/route.ts`)

**Before (BROKEN):**
```typescript
medicalHistory: body.formData?.medicalHistory || null,  // Tried to store object
allergies: body.formData?.allergies || null,
emergencyContact: body.formData?.emergencyContact || null  // Tried to store object
```

**After (FIXED):**
```typescript
// Convert nested objects to strings
medicalHistory: typeof medicalHistory === 'object' 
  ? JSON.stringify(medicalHistory)  // Store as JSON string
  : (medicalHistory || null),

allergies: typeof medicalHistory === 'object'
  ? (medicalHistory.allergies?.join(', ') || null)  // "Penicillin, Latex"
  : (body.formData?.allergies || null),

medications: typeof medicalHistory === 'object'
  ? (medicalHistory.medications?.join(', ') || null)  // "Aspirin, Ibuprofen"
  : (body.formData?.medications || null),

emergencyContact: typeof emergencyContact === 'object'
  ? `${emergencyContact.name} (${emergencyContact.relationship}) - ${emergencyContact.phone}`
  : (emergencyContact || null),
```

### Bonus Fixes:

**Field Name Mapping:**
- `consentAcknowledged` → `consentGiven`
- `photoConsent` → `photographyConsent`
- Handles `clientSignature` in either `formData` or root level

**Backward Compatible:**
- Works with old string format
- Works with new nested object format
- Gracefully handles missing fields

## 📝 Additional Fix: Signature Pad Console Spam

**Also fixed:** "Unable to preventDefault inside passive event listener" (was spamming console 30+ times)

**Solution:** Removed unnecessary `preventDefault()` calls that were triggering passive listener warnings.
