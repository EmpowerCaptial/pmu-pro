## üéØ **YES, SUBSCRIPTIONS ARE RECURRING!**

## üìä **System Configuration Details:**

### **API Configuration** (`/app/api/artist/subscribe/route.ts`)
```typescript
mode: 'subscription'  // ‚úÖ RECURRING BILLING ENABLED
```

This is the critical line! `mode: 'subscription'` tells Stripe to:
- Create a **recurring subscription** (not one-time payment)
- Automatically charge every month
- Handle renewals, upgrades, downgrades
- Track subscription lifecycle

### **Price IDs Setup:**
```typescript
const PRICE_IDS = {
  starter: process.env.STRIPE_PRICE_STARTER || 'price_starter_monthly',
  professional: process.env.STRIPE_PRICE_PRO || 'price_professional_monthly',
  studio: process.env.STRIPE_PRICE_ENTERPRISE || 'price_studio_monthly'
}
```

‚úÖ All plans reference monthly price IDs

---

## üîÑ **What Happens Each Month:**

### **Month 1 (Initial Subscription):**
1. User clicks "Upgrade to Professional ($99/mo)"
2. Stripe checkout: `mode: 'subscription'`
3. User pays $99
4. `hasActiveSubscription = true`
5. User gets full access

### **Month 2 (Automatic Renewal):**
1. **Stripe automatically charges $99** (no user action needed)
2. Webhook event: `invoice.payment_succeeded`
3. Database: `subscriptionStatus = 'active'`
4. User continues with full access

### **If Payment Fails:**
1. Webhook event: `invoice.payment_failed`
2. Database: `subscriptionStatus = 'past_due'`
3. User redirected to update payment method
4. Stripe retries payment automatically

## üéì **Trial to Paid Conversion:**

### **30-Day Free Trial:**
```typescript
// User starts trial (no payment)
trialEndDate: 30 days from now
```

### **During Trial - User Can Upgrade:**
```typescript
isTrialUpgrade: true  // System knows this is trial ‚Üí paid
```

### **After Upgrade:**
- Trial data merged with paid subscription
- `hasActiveSubscription: true`
- **Recurring billing starts immediately**
- Charged monthly automatically

## üéØ **Answer to Your Question:**

### **"If someone signed up for the trial, could they upgrade and the monthly subscription automatically becomes recurring?"**

**‚úÖ YES! Absolutely.**

1. Trial user clicks "Upgrade to Pro"
2. Enters payment info once
3. Stripe creates recurring subscription
4. **Charged $99/month automatically**
5. They never have to "re-subscribe" or "renew manually"
6. Subscription continues until they cancel

### **"Are the subscriptions all set up for recurring?"**

**‚úÖ YES! Code is configured correctly.**

**‚ö†Ô∏è  HOWEVER:** You must verify in Stripe Dashboard that the Price IDs are set to "Recurring" not "One-time". If they're one-time, Stripe will only charge once.
