## 🔒 MULTI-STUDIO ISOLATION

**Scenario:** You have 100 different studios on the platform

**Studio A:**
- Owner: Jane (jane@beautystudio.com)
- Studio Name: "Jane's Beauty Studio"
- Student: Sarah (studioName: "Jane's Beauty Studio")

**Studio B:**
- Owner: Mark (mark@pmupro.com)
- Studio Name: "Mark's PMU Studio"
- Student: Tom (studioName: "Mark's PMU Studio")

**System Behavior:**
- ✅ Sarah fetches services from Jane (matched by studioName)
- ✅ Tom fetches services from Mark (matched by studioName)
- ✅ No cross-contamination
- ✅ Each studio completely isolated

---

## 🛡️ WHAT'S PROTECTED

### Critical Data in Database:
1. ✅ User accounts (all roles)
2. ✅ Services
3. ✅ Service assignments
4. ✅ Studio names
5. ✅ Business names
6. ✅ Team relationships

### What's in localStorage (Non-Critical):
- Team member cache (rebuilt from database on load)
- UI preferences
- Temporary session data

**Loss of localStorage = No data loss!**

---

## 📱 MULTI-DEVICE SUPPORT

**Owner on Desktop:**
- Assigns services to student
- Saves to database

**Student on Phone (PWA):**
- Opens app
- Fetches assignments from database
- Sees assigned services immediately ✅

**Cross-device sync works perfectly!**
