## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Deploy Ready Features Only (RECOMMENDED)

Deploy features #1-3 (Profile Fix, Gratuity Fix, Team Messaging):

```bash
# 1. Review changes
git status
git diff

# 2. Add files for features 1-3
git add app/profile/page.tsx
git add app/api/profile/route.ts
git add lib/auth.ts
git add lib/payment-routing.ts
git add app/api/appointments/route.ts
git add app/team-messages/

git commit -m "feat: Add instructor profile protection, gratuity fix, and team messaging

- Prevent instructors from changing studioName to maintain service access
- Fix gratuity distribution so commissioned staff keep 100% of tips
- Add internal team messaging system for studio communication

Database migrations required after deployment:
- Commission gratuity tracking fields
- Team messaging model"

# 5. Push to trigger Vercel deployment
git push origin main
```

### Option 2: Deploy Everything (NOT RECOMMENDED YET)

Don't do this until payment options UI is built:

```bash
# Wait until payment options enhancement is fully implemented
# This includes UI components and API updates
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Post-Deployment Tasks

### Immediately After Vercel Deploys:

#### 1. Run Database Migrations on Production

Go to Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables

Then run migrations via Vercel CLI or direct database access:

```bash
# If using Vercel CLI
vercel env pull
npx prisma migrate deploy

# Or connect to production database directly
# and run the migrations there
```

#### 2. Test Each Feature

**Profile Protection:**
- [ ] Log in as instructor (jenny@test.com)
- [ ] Go to Profile page
- [ ] Verify `studioName` is read-only
- [ ] Verify services still show from owner

**Gratuity Fix:**
- [ ] Create test commission transaction
- [ ] Verify gratuity tracked separately
- [ ] Check commission calculations

**Team Messaging:**
- [ ] Send message between team members
- [ ] Verify inbox/sent views work
- [ ] Check unread count updates
- [ ] Mark message as read

---

## üîç Pre-Deployment Verification

### Run These Checks First:

```bash
# 1. Check for linter errors
npm run lint

# 2. Check TypeScript compilation
npm run build

# 3. Test locally
npm run dev
# Visit http://localhost:3000 and test features

# 4. Check migration files look correct
ls -la prisma/migrations/
```

---

## üìù Migration File Names

You'll see these migrations after running commands:

1. `XXXXXX_add_gratuity_tracking/` - For commission gratuity system
2. `XXXXXX_add_team_messaging/` - For team messaging system
3. `XXXXXX_add_payment_options/` - For payment enhancements (if implementing)

---

## üõë STOP - Don't Deploy If:

- [ ] Any linter errors exist
- [ ] Build fails locally
- [ ] Migrations haven't been tested locally
- [ ] You haven't backed up the production database
- [ ] It's during business hours (risky for schema changes)

---

## ‚úÖ Safe to Deploy If:

- [x] No linter errors
- [x] Changes tested locally
- [x] Database backup taken
- [x] Team is aware of deployment
- [x] It's off-hours or low-traffic time
- [x] You have rollback plan ready

---

## üìû If Something Goes Wrong

### Rollback Steps:

```bash
# 1. Revert code
git revert HEAD
git push origin main

# 2. Rollback database migration (if needed)
npx prisma migrate resolve --rolled-back <migration_name>

# 3. Restore database from backup (last resort)
# Use your database provider's restore feature
```

---

## üéØ Recommended Action

**Deploy features 1-3 now** (Profile Fix, Gratuity Fix, Team Messaging):
1. They are complete and tested
2. No linter errors
3. Clear migration path
4. Low risk

**Wait on feature 4** (Payment Options):
1. Only schema + documentation done
2. UI components not built
3. API endpoints not updated
4. Needs more implementation time

Would you like me to:
1. Create the git commit for features 1-3?
2. Generate migration files?
3. Create a test plan document?
