# Gratuity System Fix Summary

## What Was Fixed

**Issue**: Commissioned staff were having their gratuity/tips split with the studio owner according to their commission rate.

**Solution**: Updated the payment system so that commissioned employees keep 100% of their gratuity, while only the service amount is split according to commission rate.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema (`prisma/schema.prisma`)
Added fields to track gratuity separately from service amounts:
- `gratuityAmount` - Tips received (goes 100% to staff)
- `staffTotalAmount` - Total staff receives (commission + gratuity)

### 2. Payment Routing Logic (`lib/payment-routing.ts`)
- Updated `getPaymentRouting()` to accept separate service and gratuity amounts
- Modified commission calculations to only apply to service amount
- Added gratuity tracking in PaymentRoutingResult interface

### 3. Commission Recording (`lib/payment-routing.ts`)
- Updated `recordCommissionTransaction()` to accept gratuity parameter
- Modified to calculate commission only on service amount
- Added detailed logging showing service/commission/gratuity split

### 4. Appointment API (`app/api/appointments/route.ts`)
- Updated to support gratuity parameter in booking requests
- Modified commission recording to include gratuity amount

### 5. Documentation
- Created `COMMISSION_GRATUITY_SYSTEM.md` with full system documentation
- Includes examples, best practices, and integration guidance

## Payment Distribution Examples

### Before (Incorrect):
```
Service: $450
Gratuity: $90
Total: $540
Commission Rate: 60%

Staff received: $540 × 60% = $324
Owner received: $540 × 40% = $216
```
❌ **Problem**: Owner was taking 40% of the tip!

### After (Correct):
```
Service: $450
Gratuity: $90
Total: $540
Commission Rate: 60%

Staff received: ($450 × 60%) + $90 = $360
Owner received: $450 × 40% = $180
```
✅ **Fixed**: Staff keeps 100% of gratuity!

## Database Migration Required

After deploying these changes, run:

```bash
# Apply schema changes
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_gratuity_tracking

# Regenerate Prisma client
npx prisma generate

# If in production, use:
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

## Testing Checklist

### For Commissioned Staff
- [ ] Book appointment with service + gratuity
- [ ] Verify commission calculated only on service amount
- [ ] Verify 100% of gratuity goes to staff
- [ ] Check commission transaction record shows correct split

## Deployment Steps

1. **Backup Database** (important!)
   ```bash
   # Production backup before schema change
   pg_dump $DATABASE_URL > backup_before_gratuity_fix.sql
   ```

2. **Deploy Code Changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix: Commissioned staff now keep 100% of gratuity"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Run Migration**
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate deploy
   ```

4. **Verify**
   - Test booking with gratuity
   - Check commission calculations
   - Review financial reports

## Impact Assessment

### Positive Impacts
- ✅ Fair compensation for service providers
- ✅ Industry-standard tip handling
- ✅ Better staff satisfaction and retention
- ✅ Transparent financial tracking
- ✅ Compliant with labor laws

### Financial Impact
- **For Staff**: Increased take-home from tips
- **For Owners**: Reduced revenue from gratuity (but this is correct/legal)
- **Example**: On a $90 tip with 60/40 split:
  - Staff gains: $36 more per transaction
  - Owner loses: $36 per transaction

### No Impact On
- Service price commission splits
- Booth renter arrangements
- Student supervision structure
- Tax calculations (tips were always tracked)

## Communication Plan

### To Staff Members
> "We've updated our payment system to ensure all commissioned staff members receive 100% of their gratuity/tips. Commission rates still apply to service prices, but tips now go entirely to you. This change is effective immediately for all new bookings."

### To Studio Owners
> "We've corrected our gratuity handling to ensure tips go 100% to the service provider, which is industry standard and legally compliant. Your commission rate still applies to the service amount. This change improves staff satisfaction and ensures regulatory compliance."

## Questions & Answers

**Q: Why don't we split tips with the owner?**
A: Industry standard and fair labor practice is that tips go to the service provider. Many jurisdictions have laws requiring this.

**Q: Will this affect my existing commission records?**
A: No, historical records remain unchanged. Only new transactions will use the new calculation method.

**Q: Can we configure tip splitting percentage?**
A: Currently no - tips always go 100% to staff for commissioned employees. This is a fixed business rule.

**Q: What about students?**
A: Students are learning/supervised, so all revenue (including tips) goes to the owner's account. Students are compensated through their educational arrangement.

**Q: What about booth renters?**
A: Booth renters already receive 100% of everything (service + tips). This change doesn't affect them.
