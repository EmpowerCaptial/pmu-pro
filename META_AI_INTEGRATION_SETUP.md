# ðŸš€ Meta Business AI Integration Setup Guide

## ðŸŽ¯ **What This System Does:**

- **AI sits in Meta Messenger** waiting for customer messages

- **Artist can choose** between AI Assistant or Manual Response
- **24/7 customer service** without artist intervention

## ðŸ”§ **Setup Steps:**

### **Step 1: Environment Variables**

Add these to your `.env.local` file:

```bash
# Meta Business Integration
META_VERIFY_TOKEN=pmu_pro_ai_2024
META_PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_page_access_token_here

# OpenAI/Groq API for AI responses
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
```

### **Step 2: Meta Business Setup**

1. **Go to [Meta for Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/)**
2. **Create a new app** or use existing
3. **Add Messenger product** to your app
4. **Get Page Access Token** from your Facebook page
5. **Set up webhook** with URL: `https://yourdomain.com/api/meta/webhook`

### **Step 3: Artist Configuration**

## ðŸ“± **Customer Experience:**

**AI:** "Hi! I'd be happy to help you book a microblading appointment. I can see available slots on Tuesday at 2 PM, Wednesday at 10 AM, or Friday at 3 PM. Which works best for you?"

**Customer:** "Tuesday at 2 PM works great!"

**AI:** "Perfect! I've booked your microblading appointment for Tuesday at 2 PM. You'll receive a confirmation email shortly. Is there anything else you'd like to know about your appointment?"
