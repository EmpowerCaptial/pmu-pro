# Geolocation Database Fix

## 🚨 Critical Issues Fixed

You were **100% correct** - there were **THREE major problems**:

### ❌ **Problem 1: NOT Saving to Database**
The API was **fake** - it just returned "success" without actually saving anything to the database. Settings were ONLY in localStorage, which means:
- Data lost on browser clear
- Not shared across devices
- Not persistent
- Owner couldn't change/delete later

### ❌ **Problem 2: Wrong API Endpoint**
The page was calling `/api/studio/location-settings` but the file was `/api/studio/geolocation-settings` - they didn't match, so settings couldn't load.

### ❌ **Problem 3: NO Access Control**
**Anyone** could access the settings page and API - no role checking for owners/managers/directors only.

---

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. **Created Database Model**
Added `StudioSettings` table to Prisma schema:

```prisma
model StudioSettings {
  id          String   @id @default(cuid())
  studioName  String   @unique // Studio name from owner's account
  ownerEmail  String   // Owner's email
  address     String   // Physical studio address
  lat         Float    // Latitude
  lng         Float    // Longitude
  radius      Float    @default(50) // Geofencing radius in meters
  isActive    Boolean  @default(true)
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime @updatedAt
  updatedBy   String?  // Email of person who last updated

  @@index([studioName])
  @@index([ownerEmail])
  @@map("studio_settings")
}
```

**Pushed to production database:** ✅ Complete

---

### 2. **Rewrote API to Use Database**

**File:** `app/api/studio/geolocation-settings/route.ts`

**GET Endpoint:**
- ✅ Verifies user is owner/manager/director
- ✅ Fetches from `studio_settings` table using `studioName`
- ✅ Returns actual saved data or empty defaults
- ✅ Returns 403 if unauthorized

**POST Endpoint:**
- ✅ Verifies user is owner/manager/director
- ✅ Uses Prisma `upsert` to create or update settings
- ✅ Saves to database permanently
- ✅ Returns 403 if unauthorized

**Before:**
```typescript
// Line 11: "For now, bypass database queries entirely..."
return NextResponse.json({ success: true }) // Fake!
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Actually saves to database
const settings = await prisma.studioSettings.upsert({
  where: { studioName },
  update: { address, lat, lng, radius },
  create: { studioName, ownerEmail, address, lat, lng, radius }
})
```

---

### 3. **Fixed API Endpoint Mismatch**

**Changed in page:** `app/studio/geolocation-settings/page.tsx`

```typescript
// Before (WRONG)
fetch('/api/studio/location-settings')  // This endpoint doesn't exist!

// After (CORRECT)
fetch('/api/studio/geolocation-settings')  // Matches actual file
```

---

### 4. **Added Access Control**

**API Level:**
```typescript
// Only owners, managers, and directors can access
if (!['owner', 'manager', 'director'].includes(user.role)) {
  return NextResponse.json({ 
    error: 'Access denied',
    message: 'Only studio owners, managers, and directors can access geolocation settings'
  }, { status: 403 })
}
```

**Page Level:**
```typescript
// Check access before rendering
const canAccess = currentUser?.role === 'owner' || 
                 currentUser?.role === 'manager' || 
                 currentUser?.role === 'director'

if (!canAccess) {
  return <AccessDenied />  // Shows error message
}
```

---

### 5. **Updated Hook to Query Database**

**File:** `hooks/use-clock-in-out.ts`

**Before:**
```typescript
// Tried localStorage first, then API fallback
const savedSettings = localStorage.getItem(studioKey)
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Always loads from database API
const response = await fetch('/api/studio/geolocation-settings')
if (data.settings && data.settings.isConfigured) {
  setStudioLocation({ lat, lng, address, radius })
}
```

## 📊 How It Works Now

### **Saving Settings (Owner):**

1. Owner logs in → Goes to "Studio Location" 
2. Enters address: "123 Main St, Springfield MO 65802"
3. Clicks "Geocode Address" → Gets lat/lng coordinates
4. Clicks "Save Settings"
5. **API saves to database** `studio_settings` table:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO studio_settings (
     studioName, ownerEmail, address, lat, lng, radius
   ) VALUES (
     'Universal Beauty Studio Academy',
     'tyronejackboy@gmail.com',
     '123 Main St...',
     37.xxxxx,
     -93.xxxxx,
     50
   )
   ```
6. Settings **permanently stored** in database ✅

---

### **Loading Settings (Student Clock-In):**

1. Student clicks red clock icon
2. Hook calls `/api/studio/geolocation-settings`
3. API queries database:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM studio_settings
   WHERE studioName = 'Universal Beauty Studio Academy'
   ```
4. Returns: `{ lat: 37.xxxxx, lng: -93.xxxxx, radius: 50 }`
5. Hook checks if student within 50 meters
6. If YES → Clock in ✅
7. If NO → Error with distance shown ❌

---

### **Changing Settings:**

Owner can:
- ✅ Update address anytime
- ✅ Change radius (make it bigger/smaller)
- ✅ Re-geocode if moved locations
- ✅ Settings persist across browser clears
- ✅ Settings work on any device owner logs in from

---

## 🔐 Access Control

### Who Can Access:
- ✅ **Owner** (role: "owner")
- ✅ **Manager** (role: "manager")
- ✅ **Director** (role: "director")

### Who CANNOT Access:
- ❌ **Students** (role: "student")
- ❌ **Instructors** (role: "instructor")
- ❌ **Licensed Artists** (role: "licensed")
- ❌ **Unauthenticated users**

### What Happens If Unauthorized:
```
API Response: 403 Forbidden
{
  "error": "Access denied",
  "message": "Only studio owners, managers, and directors can access geolocation settings"
}

Page Shows:
  🚫 Access Restricted
  Geolocation settings can only be configured by studio owners and managers.
  Your current role: student
```

3. **Verify:** Check database has record:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM studio_settings 
   WHERE ownerEmail = 'tyronejackboy@gmail.com'
   ```
4. **Verify:** Reload page → Address still there ✅

5. Change address → Save again
6. **Verify:** Database updated with new coordinates ✅

### ✅ **As Student (Jenny):**
1. Try to access `/studio/geolocation-settings`
2. **Expected:** "Access Restricted" page ✅

```

### After Fix:
```
Owner saves → PostgreSQL database ✅
Browser clears → Data PERSISTS ✅
Different device → Loads from database ✅
Student clock-in → Checks actual studio location ✅
```
